# How To Quit It

## Quick reference on how to quit command line tools, REPLs, etc.

### Unfortunately there's no standardization around this, so we need a cheatsheet!

#### Notes

- The character `>` should be read as "then", e.g. `Esc > q` means "press Escape, then press q"
- Assume that you have to press the Enter key to run the command unless otherwise noted
